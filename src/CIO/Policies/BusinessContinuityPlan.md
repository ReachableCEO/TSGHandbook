## Data

In the event of a data failure, data should be recovered from the most recent backup, to have as minimal impact on daily operations as possible.

* All data lives canonically at PFV
* All data resides in ZFS volumes on pfv-stor2 and pfv-stor1
* All ZFS volumes are continuously snapshotted in place on array
* All ZFS volumes are replicated at various intervals depending on recovery time objectives to pfv-stor1 backup drive


## Equipment

In the event of an equipment failure, equipment is to be replaced as soon as possible, utlizing insurance policies as necessary to recoup losses imposed. Replacesments are to be obtained, and data recovered, as soon as possible, to have as minimal impact on daily opersation as possible.

## Facility

As of the time of this writing, PFV is the only location, and in the event it should become permanently unavailable, obtaining use of a coworking space, such as WeWork or Capitol Factory, for continued dailiy operations is a must, until new dedicated facilities become available.

## Personnel

* In the event that the CEO is no longer willing or able to perform their duties, the next officer in succession is the CFO. The CFO shall perform the duties of both officers, until such time as a replacement can be found.

* In the event that the CFO is no longer willing or able to perform their duties, the next officer in succession is the CMO. The CMO shall perform the duties of both officers, until such time as a replacement can be found.

* In the event the CMO is no longer willing or able to perform their duties, the CTO shall perform the duties of CEO/CFO/CMO and will be acting CEO/CFO/COM until such time as a replacement can be found.
