# TSYS Group - CIO Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the TSYS Group Handbook - CIO Documentation.

We strive to be as open, transparent and responsive as possible as we support the mission of the TSYS Group and it's component divisions.

We are glad you are here. :)

This manual serves as the sole source of documentation for all IT operations/systems/services of TSYS Group.

We strive to provide a complete suite of services utilizing an almost entirely FLO stack. The FLO exceptions are:

* Office 365 for e-mail
* Neat.com for expense receipt OCR
* Windows 10 workstations
* Apple IOS devices

The entirety of our servers are running Ubuntu 20.04 or later.

Other than the above exceptions, we utilize 100% FLO software to implement every single IT and Business service delivered to
the TSYS group. We hope our documentation helps you do the same.
