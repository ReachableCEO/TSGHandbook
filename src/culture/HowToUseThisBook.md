## How to Use This Book

This book isn’t about fringe benefits or how to set up your workstation or where to find source code. TSYS Group works in ways that might seem counterintuitive at first. This hand-
book is about the choices you’re going to be making and how to think about them. Mainly, it’s about how not to freak out now that you’re here.

For more nuts-and-bolts information, there’s an official TSYS Group Doc Repo : TODO link to repo
