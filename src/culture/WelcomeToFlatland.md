## Welcome to Flatland

Hierarchy is great for maintaining predictability and repeatability. It simplifies planning and makes it easier to
control a large group of people from the top down, which is why military organizations rely on it so heavily.

But when you’re a day zero company that’s spent the last decade going out of its way to identify and recruit the most
intelligent, innovative, talented people on Earth to be members of the organization, telling them to sit at a desk and 
do what they’re told obliterates 99 percent of their value.

We want innovators, and that means maintaining an environment where they’ll flourish.  That’s why TSYS Group is flat. It’s our shorthand way of
saying that we don’t have any middle management, just a highly dedicated senior leadership team (made of up the organization co-founders) and a fully
independent Board of Directors (with the power to remove management if necessary) to ensure all stakeholders are fully represented.

All meetings of the Board and leadership are open participation (read only) and our CEO (@ReachableCEO everywhere) is highly responsive to all levels of the
organization and external stakeholders.

The organization truly belongs to it's members, it's yours! Yours to steer—toward opportunities and away from risks.

You have the power to green-light projects. You have the power to ship products.

A flat structure removes every organizational barrier between your work and the customer enjoying that work.

Every company will tell you that “the customer is boss,” but here that statement has weight. There’s no red tape stopping you from figuring out for yourself what our customers
want, and then giving it to them.

If you’re thinking to yourself, “Wow, that sounds like a lot of responsibility,” you’re right. 

And that’s why onboarding new members is the single most important thing you will ever do at TSYS Group.

Any time you vet a potential member, you need to ask yourself not only if they’re exceptionally talented and collaborative but also if they’re capable of literally running this organization, because they will be.
