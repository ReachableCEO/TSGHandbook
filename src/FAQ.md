
* What is the overall vision?

We envision a world where everyone is able to connect without interference, censorship at a cost always trending lower (as close to zero) as possible.

* What is the specific startup idea being worked on?

Inexpensive (by the hour) high altitude balloon launch , flight and recovery service of any cubesat payload under 5lbs.

* What progress has already made/can you make without a co-founder?

Many test flights. Proof of concepts. Build out of R&D and corporate infrastructure. Production of a prototype of the MorsePOD (consumer electronics piece of the
overall stack).

* How does the CEO respond to stress/difficult situations?

Mostly by avoiding them in the first place. Otherwise confronting them head on calmly and rationally.

* What motivates the CEO?

Lifting the overall GDP share of everyday americans by democratizing internet access.

* Why does the CEO want to work on a startup?

The need to solve a very big problem. Incumbents will never solve it. The world needs to be better connected by an organization that isn't inherently 
conflicted (ie google/face3book)

* What’s the ideal trajectory for you: venture-backed rocket ship, lifestyle business, something in between?

Building a conglomerate of entities (non profit, coop, capital aggregation, not primarily for profit). We plan to produce long term cash flow for our stakeholders. We plan to raise substantial institutional capital and deploy it at industrial scale.

* What skills do you have; are they complementary? Will you be able to build an initial version of a product together?

20 years of design, building, scaling, securing of systems for a wide range of government and private sector customers.

* How will this vision be realized?

The short version is to have 100,000 or more balloons up at all times and provide an always on IOT (lora) and end user (IP) serving backbone.

* Have you taken any outside capital?

Not at this time (August 2021)

* Why haven't you raised any outside capital?

We are building the structure / systems / processes to successfully onboard large amounts of capital.

* What types of capital are you raising?

** For seed (non dilutive): SBIR

** For dilutive equity (max 25%): Institutional (Goldman sachs, Blackrock and other long term cash flow oriented funds) (see the operating agreement sections of the
handbook for terms we would raise under)

* Do you require an NDA?

No NDA is necessary for the majority of members. The exception is if you are granted on-going access to trade secrets as part of your mission , you'll be required to execute a confidentiality agreement that is tightly scoped to those secrets and is limited to the term of your membership plus one year.

In rare circumstances, you'll need to sign a perpetual confidentiality agreement, again scoped to the specific trade secrets you'll have access to.

* What is the structure of the entity?

We are a combination of different corporate forms. The specific structure is a trade secret. Ownership is disclosed to those who execute a membership agreement. You can find the membership agreement in the TSG Handbook.

* What is the name of the entity?

Suborbital Systems Development Company LLC (Texas LLC) is one we disclose.

* What is the governance structure of the entity?

We have a (not yet formally elected ) board of directors. The CEO (@ReachableCEO) has personal advisors who aren’t directors but provide him with outside perspective on a variety of matters. YOu can find details on governance at <https://governance.turnsys.com> .

* How are folks compensated?

(as of August 2021) No one takes a salary. It’s all a promise of future payout, based on profit interest grants in the LLC.

We are currently working towards SBIR grant. This requires a full time employee (principal investigator ). That person will not have a profit interest, as the operating agreement doesn’t allow for salary if you have a profit interest grant.  

Keep in mind, having a profit interest grant is a (very strong) contract , vs employment which is at will.
